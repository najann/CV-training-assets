# TensorflowJS Demo

This subdirectory contains the code for a tfjs demo consisting of two containers.
A deployed version (IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service) can be found [here](http://173.193.68.8:31323/).

## FastAPI

For the model data provision, I used [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com).
It's another Python web framework.
However, its intention is not to be an entire web application kit but it concentrates on APIs.
