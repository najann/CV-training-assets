# CV Training Assets

This repository contains some demo applications accompanying the lectures by Björn Schmitz at the KIT.
There is a specific ReadMe for each demo in the corresponding subfolder.
Therefore, this ReadMe is targeted at providing some general insights and experience gained during the development of computer vision demos.

I concentrated on using the currently most popular libraries, namely PyTorch, Keras resp. Tensorflow and OpenCV.

## BentoML

"BentoML is an open-source framework for high-performance machine learning model serving." ([BentoML](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/))
It facilitates deployment-related, preparative and operative tasks in the field of ML models.
Conveniently, BentoML even produces a Dockerfile which you can use to containerize your model and provide an easy API.

## Flask vs. Bottle vs. Pyramid

## TensorflowJS
